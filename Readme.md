# About

This Repository is done for educational purposes. It is the first React Project I did. I did it during the [Frontend Developer Program](https://edu.opencampus.sh/en/course/94) by [Open Campus](https://www.opencampus.sh) in Kiel. All of the Code is written by me. Some part I wrote following Tutorials and Courses. Nothing is just copy-pasted!

## Pie and Donut Charts

I had to design Pie and Donut Charts. If it would be for a real World Project it would have been quite possible that I choose a Library for Pie and Donut Charts. At first glance Chart.js seemed like a good oportunity. But I decided to craft the charts by myself. Its not rocket-since complicated and also a good practice, although it may take a bit longer.
